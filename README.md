# RabbitMQ-Training

Exercises from the [Pivotal Education course on RabbitMQ](https://courses.education.pivotal.io/c/349803597/index.html)

Each example has its own publisher and consumer

```
→ tree quorum-queue-solution/
quorum-queue-solution/
├── publisher
│   └── main.go
└── subscriber
    └── main.go
```

So to run each example, fire up 2 terminals and run the publisher and subscriber with `go run`
